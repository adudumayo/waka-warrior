## If you love coding and unnecessary levels of competition, you’re in the right place.  

## The Plan  
1. **Scrape WakaTime’s leaderboard** – I need to know who I’m up against.  
2. **Filter for South African and African developers** – So I know exactly who to dethrone.   
3. **Out-code everyone** – Sleep is for the weak.

## How It Works  
- Uses **Python** (because obviously).  
- Scrapes WakaTime leaderboard and filters by region. 

## Disclaimer  
I think this project is **100% legal**. It’s just scraping public data, after all. But if I suddenly disappear, assume I got too powerful.  

## Join the Mission  
- Fork it.  
- Run it.  
- **Out-code them.**
  
## Last Words From Me
I either **become a coding weapon of mass destruction** or **burn out spectacularly**. Either way, it’s going to be fun.
